# PointClouds.jl

*Fast & flexible processing of lidar data*

[PointClouds.jl](https://github.com/efpl-columbia/PointClouds.jl) lets you
query publicly available lidar point-cloud datasets, download the data for
regions of interest, and explore & process the data locally. You can access all
attributes stored in [LAS/LAZ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAS_file_format)
files and construct purpose-built processing pipelines that extract information
about the local environment from point-cloud data.

## Features & Goals

[![Online Documentation](https://img.shields.io/badge/ðŸ•®-Online_Documentation-2C6BAC)](https://docs.mfsch.dev/PointClouds.jl/)

PointClouds.jl aims to provide all functionality for an ergonomic,
high-performance workflow to acquire and process point-cloud data. The initial
development is focused on producing robust primitives for such a workflow.
Over time, we expect the functionality to expand, building out a comprehensive
library of point-cloud processing algorithms similar to
[PDAL](https://pdal.io/) and [lidR](https://r-lidar.github.io/lidRbook/).

- spatial queries of the [USGS 3DEP lidar
  data](https://www.usgs.gov/3d-elevation-program) with near-total coverage of
  the United States
- reading & writing [LAS/LAZ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAS_file_format)
  files (v1.0â€¯â€“â€¯v1.4), including files that do not fit into memory
- lazy filtering & updating of LAS/LAZ points
- parsing LAS coordinate reference system (CRS) data in WKT & GeoTIFF formats;
  coordinate transforms
- multi-threaded in-memory processing of point-cloud data, including
  neighborhood-based processing
- rasterization of point-cloud data based on points within pixel footprint,
  points within radius of pixel center, and *k* nearest neighbors of pixel
  center

## Quickstart

To start using PointClouds.jl, add it to a [Julia environment](https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/getting-started/#Getting-Started-with-Environments) e.g. using the [Pkg REPL](https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/getting-started/#Basic-Usage):

```julia-repl
(@v1.10) pkg> add PointClouds
```

> [!TIP]
> Since PointClouds.jl is rather new and under active development,
> backwards-incompatible changes may occur regularly. It is therefore
> recommended to add a specific version to your Julia environment (e.g. with
> [`Pkg.compat`](https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/api/#Pkg.compat) or
> [`Pkg.pin`](https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/api/#Pkg.pin) and to be careful
> when updating to new (non-patch) versions.

After that, the package can be loaded as usual:

```julia-repl
julia> using PointClouds
```

Load a LAS/LAZ file to access the point data:

```julia-repl
julia> pts = LAS("USGS_LPC_Sandy_Supplemental_NCR_VA_MD_DC_QL2_LiDAR_18SUJ322306.laz")

```
