# Explore & Process 3D Point-Cloud Data

[PointClouds.jl](https://github.com/efpl-columbia/PointClouds.jl) lets you
query publicly available lidar point-cloud datasets, download the data for
regions of interest, and explore & process the data locally. You can access all
attributes stored in [LAS/LAZ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAS_file_format)
files and construct purpose-built processing pipelines that extract information
about the local environment from point-cloud data.

## Features & Goals

[![Online Documentation](https://img.shields.io/badge/ðŸ•®-Online_Documentation-2C6BAC)](https://docs.mfsch.dev/PointClouds.jl/)

PointClouds.jl aims to provide all functionality for an ergonomic,
high-performance workflow to acquire and process point-cloud data. The initial
development is focused on producing robust primitives for such a workflow.
Over time, we expect the functionality to expand, building out a comprehensive
library of point-cloud processing algorithms similar to
[PDAL](https://pdal.io/) and [lidR](https://r-lidar.github.io/lidRbook/).

- spatial queries of the [USGS 3DEP lidar
  data](https://www.usgs.gov/3d-elevation-program) with near-total coverage of
  the United States
- reading & writing [LAS/LAZ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAS_file_format)
  files (v1.0â€¯â€“â€¯v1.4), including files that do not fit into memory
- lazy filtering & updating of LAS/LAZ points
- parsing LAS coordinate reference system (CRS) data in WKT & GeoTIFF formats;
  coordinate transforms
- multi-threaded in-memory processing of point-cloud data, including
  neighborhood-based processing
- rasterization of point-cloud data based on points within pixel footprint,
  points within radius of pixel center, and *k* nearest neighbors of pixel
  center

## Quickstart

PointClouds.jl is not yet available in the Julia package repository. It can be added to a [Julia environment](https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/getting-started/#Getting-Started-with-Environments) by using the link of the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/efpl-columbia/PointClouds.jl), e.g.

```julia-repl
pkg> add https://github.com/efpl-columbia/PointClouds.jl
```

After that, the package can be loaded as usual:

```jldoctest
julia> using PointClouds
```
